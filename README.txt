NARRATIVE

I decided to do a Recipe Generator because I wanted to do something silly. I 
figured that this wouldn’t work the way I wanted it to because language can
be pretty hard to simulate, so I thought that instead of working against it 
I’ll work with it to make something silly. This code was definitely not as
hard as the P5JS, and it was pretty easy to figure out everything - two
challenges I did have though, was getting the words one each line to stay
together (the words that had spaces on each line kept getting seperated) and
having to figure out that I had to use the noloop() function and basically leave
the draw frunction blank to get the words to show up on the screen properly. I
think the hardest thing was just getting certain things to repeat in places because
I am not familiar with JavaScript dictionaries – I got help from the teacher to fix 
this issue (which was an easy fix). Honestly, once I finished the project I was 
glad to see the ridiculous recipes that it came up with.



CORPUS AND OUTPUT

I wouldn't consider my output "interesting" in a sense that it's not what I want 
or that it's grammer is unpredictable, but I think it's interesting because of 
how rediculous it is. I think that it would've been pretty cool to have directions
written which would be considered "interesting". I think if I had a bit more love for 
this specific project it probably woul've been a lot cooler.
