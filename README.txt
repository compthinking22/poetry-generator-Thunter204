NARRATIVE

I decided to do a Recipe Generator because I wanted to do something silly. I 
figured that this wouldn’t work the way I wanted it to because language can
be pretty hard to simulate, so I thought that instead of working against it 
I’ll work with it to make something silly. This code was definitely not as
hard as the P5JS, and it was pretty easy to figure out everything. I think the
hardest thing was just getting certain things to repeat in places because I am 
not familiar with JavaScript dictionaries – I got help from the teacher to fix 
this issue (which was an easy fix). Honestly, once I finished the project I was 
glad to see the ridiculous recipes that it came up with.



CORPUS AND OUTPUT

I wouldn't consider my output "interesting" in a sense that it's not what I want 
or that it's grammer is unpredictable, but I think it's interesting because of 
how rediculous it is. I think that it would've been pretty cool to have directions
written out but I know that probably would've made my brain melt.
